According to music historians, operatic pop songs became most prevalent with the rise of Tin Pan Alley musicians during the early 1900s. One influence was the large influx of Italian immigrants to the United States who popularized singers such as Enrico Caruso and inspired the creation of \"novelty songs\" using Italian dialect. The songs often used operatic repertory \"to make a satirical or topical point\". Popularized by American Vaudeville, musical comedies, jazz and operettas, examples include Irving Berlin's \"That Opera Rag\", Billy Murray's \"My Cousin Caruso\" and Louis Armstrong's riffs on \"Rigoletto\" and \"Pagliacci\". The subgenre subsequently dwindled after the 1920s but revived during the rock music era with albums such as The Who's \"Tommy\" and Queen's \"A Night at The Opera\".",

He was located in Williamstown (Glengarry County), and later, Hamiliton in Ontario, Canada, where his wife died of cholera. He was well acquainted with the Scottish/Canadian community and was affiliated with the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. In Canada, he worked as a timber trader, schoolteacher, and a doctor. In 1834, he moved to Boston, and then New York, where he also worked as a teacher. He went on to Central America where he was a physician. He moved with gold-miners to California in 1849, and a couple of years later, poor and sick with malaria, he found enough money to board a ship to the Kingdom of Hawai\u02bb i, where he worked in many different professions. He was a medical officer for the Hawaiian Board of Health and vaccinated a number of native children with the smallpox vaccine. He was a geologist and wrote papers on the geology of the islands.

The entire plant is enveloped in loose, slippery mucilage. \"Draparnaldia\" is a cosmopolitan genus with wide distribution and it is usually found in cold aerated waters.They are either attached to sand or grow epiphytically on other aquatic plants. \"Draparnaldia\" can be seen growing in clear streams trailing on stones and boulders . Herman S. Forest of The Southern Appalachian Botanical Club has stated that while not common, it is present frequently enough to be recorded in almost all local flora lists of green algae that have been compiled. A multitude of species are present in Lake Baikal, Siberia and have been described by Meyer and Jasnitzky. It is interesting to note that a species of the genus had been placed and described in the Linnean Herbarium as Conferva Mutabilis Roth in 1797. Nowadays Conferva is no longer used and the species is described as Draparnaldia mutabilis (Roth) Bory.

It was written in response to \"Fathers and Sons\" (1862) by Ivan Turgenev. The chief character is a woman, Vera Pavlovna, who escapes the control of her family and an arranged marriage to seek economic independence. The novel advocates the creation of small socialist cooperatives based on the Russian peasant commune, but oriented toward industrial production. The author promoted the idea that the intellectual's duty was to educate and lead the laboring masses in Russia along a path to socialism that bypassed capitalism. One of the characters in the novel, Rakhmetov, became an emblem of the philosophical materialism and nobility of Russian radicalism despite his minor role. The novel also expresses, in one character's dream, a society gaining \"eternal joy\" of an earthly kind. The novel has been called \"a handbook of radicalism\" and led to the founding of the \"Land and Liberty\" society.",

The only problem was the government did not want to bury the Confederates in it. As a result of this, the South created the Hollywood Cemetery to properly bury the Confederate soldiers who lost their lives during a time of war. The name of the cemetery comes from all the holly trees inside it. The name was established way before movies were being created in the famous Hollywood everyone knows today.

The proposal for a memorial to Spalding's war dead originated in January 1918 with Barbara McLaren, whose husband and the town's Member of Parliament, Francis McLaren, was killed in a flying accident during the war. She engaged Lutyens via a family connection and the architect produced a plan for a grand memorial cloister surrounding a circular pond, in the middle of which would be a cross. The memorial was to be built in the formal gardens of Ayscoughfee Hall, which was owned by the local district council. When McLaren approached the council with her proposal, it generated considerable debate within the community and several alternative schemes were suggested. After a public meeting and a vote in 1919, a reduced-scale version of McLaren's proposal emerged as the preferred option, in conjunction with a clock on the town's corn exchange building.",

It is said the Rat Terrier background stems from the terriers or other dogs that were brought over by early English and other working class immigrants. Since the breed was a farm, hunting and utility dog there was little to no planned breeding other than breeding dogs with agreeable traits to each other in order to produce the desired work ethic in the dog. It is assumed that the Feist (dog), Bull Terrier, Smooth Fox Terrier, Manchester Terrier, Whippet, Italian Greyhound, the now extinct English White Terrier, Turnspit dog and or Wry Legged Terrier all share in the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier's ancestry. These early Ratting Terriers were then most likely bred to the Beagle or Beagle cross bred dogs (for increased scenting ability) and other dogs. Maximizing the influences from these various breeds provides the modern Teddy Roosevelt Terrier with a keen sense of awareness and prey drive, an acute sense of smell and a very high intellect. Although they tend to be aloof with strangers they are devoted companion dogs with a strong desire to please and be near their owners side at all times.",

Howie was born of four sisters and two brothers who include: Gertrude 'Kiki' Stange, Doris Stange, Frank Anthony Stange, Raymond Christopher Stange, Esther Madelyn Stange and Kathleen Leona Stange. Among the six siblings, only his youngest sister, Kathleen, lives to date, age 85. Howie achieved both national and international fame recognition, for his hit 45 record, \"Real Gone Daddy/This Old Bomb of Mine,\" released in 1957. Regarded as one of the most significant and influential Rockabilly musicians of his era, Howie's music currently resides on over 100 record compilations of the best rockabilly music ever produced. Howie's song \"Real Gone Daddy\" has achieved \"Maybelline\" status among fans. Additionally, in 1958 he went on to record \"Are You Lonesome To-Night?\" which was subsequently picked up by Elvis Presley Are You Lonesome Tonight? (song) who later went on to chart this song at number 1 on the Billboard Charts in 1960.

Proponents of this theory contend that all disputes about the obligations of a particular corporation should be settled by resort to the methods used to interpret contracts, and that courts should not imply the existence of fiduciary duties on behalf of corporate officers and directors. Alternatively, the nexus of contracts theory can also be viewed as a method of enhancing corporate plausible deniability, insofar as it is a way of \"passing the buck\" down a chain of contractual obligations and losing all semblance of responsibility in the \"nexus.\" This can pose a practical loophole for corporate entities, a theoretical strength for those wishing to forward corporate ideology, and a legal problem for those who wish to take corporate entities to court. Another strength of this theory of the firm is a firm begins to transcend border and defy simple classification when it is really intertwined by its contracts into a number of different countries and with a number of different stakeholders. For example, can General Motors be classified as strictly a U.S. company if it has contractual obligations with workings in China, customers in Europe, or stock investors in Canada?",

Some underlying questions are still under discussion regarding PKI involvement in the 30th September Movement and consequent Indonesian Massacre of 1965: what was the role of the Special Bureau, who was the main perpetrator, and what motivation did the PKI have to overthrow a leader that supported them? These questions do not have definitive answers, and are explored most extensively in John Roosa\u2019s \"Pretext for Mass Murder.\"",

It explained the racism of hosts as a reaction to the different cultural traditions of the immigrants, which acted as obstacles for their economic development and social integration. The model assumed that the disruption immigration caused to stability would be solved by the cultural assimilation of immigrants into the dominant culture. Since the 1970s, however, the assumptions in this model have been increasingly discarded in the sociology of race relations. The core idea of the model that the immigrants' children would gradually assimilate and, thus, that racism and racial inequality would cease proved false. The model was criticized and blamed for reflecting and, even, reinforcing the racist assumptions by describing the cultures of immigrants as social problems and ignoring the role structural inequality plays in their subjugation.",

In order to do this, each person must be asked about their birthplace to create an accurate record. The best way of asking though, is to ask each grandparent where they came from.

From its earliest origins in the Middle Ages, gin has evolved from use in herbal medicine to an object of commerce in the spirits industry. Gin was developed on the basis of the older jenever, and became popular in Great Britain (particularly in London) when William of Orange, leader of the Dutch Republic, occupied the English, Scottish, and Irish thrones with his wife Mary. Gin is one of the broadest categories of spirits, represented by products of various origins, styles, and flavour profiles that all revolve around juniper as a common ingredient.",

Later members included Ed Bates on guitar and Peter Martin on slide guitar. The group only existed for 18\u00a0months, however according to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, they \"virtually defined a scene that encompassed a new musical aesthetic ... [they] sang about truck drivers, roadhouses and endless highways\" and although American-influenced they \"presented a fiercely Australian outlook\". They disbanded by late 1975 leaving behind a six-track extended play, \"The Pelaco Bros.\", which appeared the following year. Camilleri formed a blues and rock music band, Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons; while Cummings and Bates formed a new wave group, The Sports in 1976.

In the season 7 episode \"Elemental,\" Princess Bubblegum was revealed to be the current Candy Elemental (in the \"Adventure Time\" universe, the Elementals are the embodiments of the four main elements that make up the world: ice, fire, candy and slime. They have existed since the beginning of life, living, dying and reincarnating for eons and millennia).

As a result, she no longer ruled the Candy Kingdom and the King of Ooo replaced her as the new ruler, until a rebellion against King of Ooo allowed her to reclaim the throne in \"The Dark Cloud\". Her proficiency in science and fluency in Korean and German are a testament to her high intelligence. In 2014, Olivia Olson (the voice actress of Marceline the Vampire Queen) alleged at a book signing that the show's creator Ward had confirmed that Marceline and Princess Bubblegum dated but were unable to put any official confirmation in the show due to controversy.

For example, some wrapped candies allow Bub and Bob to move faster, blow bubbles faster, and blow bubbles at greater distances. Other items, such as umbrellas, allow to skip numerous levels, moving closer to the final level. The game became popular and led to a long series of sequels and spin-offs.

He and his family were interned in Douglas on the Isle of Man during the Second World War. He began his career working for Filippo Del Giudice and Two Cities Films. When Two Cities was absorbed into the Rank Organisation in the mid-1940s Coen was employed by Sir David Cunynghame of London Film Productions as a subtitler. As Coen later described it in an interview, he did not know anything about subtitling at the time, and learned on the job: I finally got a phone call from London Films, Sir Cunnyngham, that 's it, who asked me whether I had ever subtitles pictures. I immediately said I had when in point of fact I did not know what he meant, and there was a young man in the office with Sir David Cunnynghame called Lew Watt, and he said Lew Watt will do the technical side and we want you to subtitle an Italian picture in to English. I said certainly . I came out of his office and Lew Watt said to me you don't know what they're talking about do you, I said you're quite right, he said well I'll show you. And I started subtitling pictures with Lew Watt, I used to do the literary side, and he used to do the technical side, the spotting, and lengths, and we together did subtitles for 40 or 50 pictures. The funny thing was we subtitled pictures in Chinese, in Indian and for the Chinese picture I had to have a Chinese waiter with me to tell me where the subtitles [...] I had the Italian dialogue and I had the picture, they gave me a film and we did the spotting together with Lew Watt and the measurements and I used to type the script. We had the film, we had the print which used to run on the two sided thing. And Lew Watt was working all the day so we had to do this at night, so we either used to work at night till 2 o'clock in the morning or we used to work at the weekends. There was always the problem that the Movieola might break down and so we had spare keys of other cutting rooms in in elm St in case we were caught. And that was how we started.Coen later founded his own company Kenilworth Film Productions and spent most of the post-war years producing second features. He made a dozen films in partnership with the director Charles Saunders. He later produced the 1971 horror film \"Burke & Hare\" and the comedies \"Au Pair Girls\" and \"Intimate Games.\"",

In its early history, the Western League struggled until 1894, when Ban Johnson became the president of the league. Johnson led the Western League into major league status and soon became the president of the newly renamed American League. The American League has one notable difference over the National League, and that is the designated hitter rule. Under the rule, a team may use a batter in their lineup who is not in the field defensively, compared to the old rule that made it mandatory for the pitcher to hit.",

The American League franchise was later shifted against the city's will to New York City with former famous player and now owner/manager John McGraw in 1903 and renamed the New York Highlanders, which later became the modern New York Yankees, a decade later (in order to give the new A.L. \"bragging rights\" by also having a team in the \"Big Apple\" versus the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers).

Some common theatrical plays done by Filipino theater focuses on the historical background of the Philippines and the relationship between the Philippines and the United States. Some Filipino American productions provides personal, societal and cultural perspective from the past to now.

During occupation by the United States, many Filipinos were recruited for manual labor along the West Coast. These early laborers commonly would perform Spanish-influenced rondallas as well as choral groups. With many Filipinos living in the United States beginning around 1900s, Filipinos have contributed towards early Americana staples such as blues and jazz, and continue to influence more modern contemporary genres such as hip hop and rock. American music has also been influential in the Philippines for artists and vice-versa. Though contributing to the evolution of American music, large number of Filipino Americans have a strong identity with culture of the Philippines by participating or organizing traditional dances and musical performances, largely in the form of PCNs on university campuses. Traditional dances and musical performances commonly practiced in the US are rondallas, choral groups, and gong chime ensembles. College campuses often organize performances on campuses, but can also have characteristics unique to America, as many Filipino Americans want to share their experiences of living in America and perform a more neo traditional variation of traditional performances.",

Often referred to as \"the quiet Beatle\", Harrison embraced Hinduism and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow bandmates as well as their American audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions.

Recorded in London without the other Beatles, the song features Indian instrumentation such as sitar, dilruba and tabla, and was performed by Harrison and members of the Asian Music Circle. The recording marked a significant departure from the Beatles' previous work; musically, it evokes the Indian devotional tradition, while the overtly spiritual quality of the lyrics reflects Harrison's absorption in Hindu philosophy and the teachings of the Vedas. Although the song was his only composition on \"Sgt. Pepper\", Harrison's endorsement of Indian culture was further reflected in the inclusion of yogis such as Paramahansa Yogananda among the crowd depicted on the album cover.",

McCartney's announcement created a reaction in the press similar to that caused in 1966 by John Lennon's statement that the Beatles were more popular than Christianity. In its finished form, the song's lyrics advocate self-awareness and consideration for the consequences of one's actions. Musically, the composition contains unusual shifts in time signature from standard 4/4 to 9/8, while the songwords reflect the era of its genesis by recalling themes first espoused in the Beatles tracks \"Within You Without You\" and \"All You Need Is Love\".",

It is the first line wide crossover since The New 52 reboot of the DC Universe, and focuses on all the villains of the DC Universe. The miniseries spins out of the events in \"Trinity War\". Johns revealed in August 2013, that the Crime Syndicate, an evil version of the Justice League from Earth-3 in the Multiverse, are the true villains of the event and not the previously thought Secret Society. The event was originally scheduled to end in March with \"Forever Evil\" #7, yet ended in May 2014, after the final issue got delayed to April, and eventually again to May. The final issue's delay was due to Johns realizing he needed more pages to conclude the story than originally intended.",

In that poem, the first \"Rose\" is the name of a person. Stein later used variations on the sentence in other writings, and \"A rose is a rose is a rose\" is among her most famous quotations, often interpreted as meaning \"things are what they are\", a statement of the law of identity, \"A is A\". In Stein's view, the sentence expresses the fact that simply using the name of a thing already invokes the imagery and emotions associated with it, an idea also intensively discussed in the problem of universals debate where Peter Abelard and others used the \"rose\" as an example concept. As the quotation diffused through her own writing, and the culture at large, Stein once remarked, \"Now listen! I\u2019m no fool. I know that in daily life we don't go around saying 'is a ... is a ... is a ...'

Generally, the plants are not found in England or western France even though suitable habitat almost certainly exists in those regions. The plants currently number about 15 species in total and include examples such as Irish Fleabane, Strawberry Tree and St Patrick's Cabbage. The group is of particular interest and importance since it is currently not understood how the current geographical distribution came about. This biogeographical puzzle has been a topic of academic debate since the middle of the 19th century. Conflicting, and as yet unresolved theories centre on whether the Irish populations are a relict, surviving from before the last ice age or whether they have been transported there in the last 10,000 years. Many of the species are also very restricted in their distribution in Ireland, and have become the centre of intense conservation efforts in recent years, for example the Irish Fleabane.",
